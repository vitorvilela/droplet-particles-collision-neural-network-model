# droplet-particles-collision-neural-network-model
Droplet Collision against a Cluster of Particles - A proposal of modeling, using neural networks, the particles wet area based on a large database of refined 2D simulations. A 2D to 3D correlation may be performed further, extending to a tridimensional scenario.
